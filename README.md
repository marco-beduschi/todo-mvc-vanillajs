# todo-mvc-vanillajs

I wanted to take my shot on creating a vanillaJS TodoMVC after reading [this blog post on frontendmasters.com](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/vanilla-javascript-todomvc/).

## Project Scope

- [x] Create TO-DOs
  - [ ] autofocus on `<input />`
  - [ ] Maintain focus on `<input />` after submitting form
  - [ ] Clear input value after submit
- [x] List TO-DOs
- [ ] Inline editing TO-DO
- [ ] Mark TO-DO as complete
- [ ] Mark ALL TO-DOs as complete
- [ ] Delete TO-DO
- [ ] Clear completed TO-DOs
- [ ] Filter TO-DOs
  - [ ] Filter by _all_
  - [ ] Filter by _active_
  - [ ] Filter by _completed_
- [ ] Add _items left counter_
  - [ ] counter should be updated on completing any TO-DO
  - [ ] counter should be updated on deleting an incomplete TO-DO
  - [ ] counter should be updated on adding a new TO-DO
- [ ] Deploy to github pages

### Out of Scope

- **CSS**. All CSS is copied from _TodoMVC boilerplate CSS_.
- **DB / Backend**. All TO-DOs are stored in-memory.
